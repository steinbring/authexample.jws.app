# authexample.jws.app
These are the files behind [authexample.jws.app](https://authexample.jws.app).  I built it during the [January 2020 RokkinCat Hack & Tell](https://rokkincat.com/hack-and-tell).

## Goals
* I really wanted to just figure out how to let people login using Microsoft, Apple, or Google credentials (that should cover everyone without having to involve Facebook or Twitter).  I couldn't figure out how to successfully get keys for Microsoft or Apple, so I had to settle for Google, Twitter, and Github.
* This really isn't an end-product.  It's more of a demo than anything.  I'm planning on using the lessons from it for another project.

## Notes
* See something that I could have done better? Feel free to fork the project.
* I used [Render](https://render.com/) for hosting and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the back-end stuff.
